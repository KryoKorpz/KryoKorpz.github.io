									<h2>The Background is not irrelevant</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/shooting-star.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										&nbsp &nbsp Thanks for tuning in and taking the time to learn a bit about yours truly. Before you can really get a sense of what Lambda has done for me and what it means to me a bit of background will help immensely. <br /><br />
										&nbsp &nbsp My road to Lambda has been atypical to say the least. 12 years since I graduated High School I have worked nearly a dozen jobs in nearly as many industries. I’ve been in food service as a dishwasher and prep worker, I’ve worked in automotive as a lube tech and assistant manager. I’ve put years into retail everything from backroom and warehouse to sales floor, inventory and employee management. My journey doesn’t stop there I was actively involved in a 12 month pre-bootcamp Navy recruit program. Where I attended drills and sail-a-longs while awaiting my enlistment date, where I was set to become a Nuclear Engineer. Due to unforeseen health problems I was discharge from boot camp early. Upon returning I entered telecommunications. Where I supported mobile phone giant Verizon with via customer service.  My journey eventually led me to a virtual claim associate position with State Farm where I was in responsible for disbursal of hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to fulfill insurance promises.  Through all this I delivered pizza, installed water-based piping in new construction, and even attempted to join the police academy.<br /><br />
										&nbsp &nbsp Needless to say I’ve done a lot in search of something. I have left all but one of my many employers of my own volition because I was in search of the career to define me. The career that will allow me to express myself and truly thrive in my own skin; this search, this journey eventually lead me to Lambda School.<br /><br />
									</p>

									<h2>My Lambda Journey</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rocket-launch.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										&nbsp &nbsp I have always been interested in computer science just never thought I’d be able to get involved. One day my wife tells me about a coding bootcamp that pays you while you learn. I thought it was worth looking into. I explored Revature and decided to apply, while I never heard back I did get the narrative started about what my life would be like in such a drastically different industry.<br /><br />
										&nbsp &nbsp Ironically I saw an advertisement on Facebook for a coding bootcamp, (thank you google/facebook for your invasive tracking of my personal browsing behaviors to give me relevant ads) I digress, that doesn’t pay you to learn; but requires zero up-front cost and promises of support after graduation since repayment only required if a relevant software engineering job is obtained that pays $50k+/year. While it sounded too good to be true; I was already invested in the career shift so I dug a bit deeper. This was during the earliest cohorts of Lambda; so they were just gaining traction in the industry and there was not a lot of information on the internet about them. I poured over random blogs and articles with snippets from Austen and Ben talking about the revolutionary school they were creating.<br /><br />
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/student-loan.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										&nbsp &nbsp It seemed completely legitmate; still too good to be true as a relevant opportunity for me. My past did not speak to many positive educational or occupational opportunities and my experience was one of scraping by desperately. College did me no favors but taught me a valuable lesson on how to survive on 40% below the national poverty level due to 60% of everything made going to the black hole that is student loans; to date I’m easily closer to $100k paid back on $50k of student loans, than not. So you can believe I was very skeptical of the promises Lambda School expressed.<br /><br />
										&nbsp &nbsp That being said I sat down and started their pre course work. My coding experience was nonexistence. I think at this point in time I MAY have “studied” enough of html/css to change the font on my Myspace page… Javascript? What voodoo is this? It took me a week or two to get through all the precourse work. I was working at the time and had an infant and toddler to look after so time was an issue. But alas I finished and submitted my application. <br /><br />
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/accepted.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										&nbsp &nbsp The anticipation was tense trying to figure out if I was going to get accepted. So in September 2017, I found a thread online where Austen had responded to a users question on acceptance rate and at less than 5% of applicants; I figured my chances of getting accepted were completely wiped.<br /><br />
										&nbsp &nbsp Turns out I was one of the 5%! I was actually accepted into the full-time program. The 4th cohort or class to be started at Lambda School, I left my job and took up the mantle of a stay-at-home dad with my 3 month old daughter and started the Lambda journey. With a lot of determination and help from family I made it 4 months into the full time 6 month course. <br /><br />
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/lunar-landing.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										&nbsp &nbsp I had never been challenged so much in my entire life. The material they were throwing at the speed they were throwing it. It was akin to being kicked out of a 3 story building in the middle of a blizzard. You’re dealing with the pain of a 3 story fall with the discombobulated orientation of a massive blizzard. The temperature is numbingly cold and you haven’t a clue as to where to go or how to get there.  Then realization sets in and you start to see past the pain and cold and see a path cut through the storm and slowly make your way out of the perilous situation you found yourself in.<br /><br />
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										&nbsp &nbsp And boy did I! Well at least with a lot of help from my family and Lambda. Unfortunately by month 4 the stress of the school and family was too much to bear so I had to make adjustments. Lambda was gracious enough to allow me to continue in their first part-time cohort. So I took over watching both my children all day and Lambda at night. This continued for the next 12 months. So my path from acceptance to graduation was not typical.<br /><br />
										&nbsp &nbsp I learned about computer programming and how to contribute and become a productive worker in an industry that seemed so alien and scary a little more than a year ago. I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything. While at times it was deflating and difficult there were more instances of extreme satisfaction. Being able to use logic to solve problems in a virtual space is so gratifying. Having an opportunity to actually express my creativity in a way that doesn’t pertain the visual arts is something that I have been searching for my whole life. I was never very successful at visual or audio arts but that didn’t mean I wasn’t creative, so to find a vehicle to express my creativity in both problem solving and aesthetics is a breath of fresh air. <br /><br />
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mars.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										&nbsp &nbsp None of this would be possible without Lambda School and their excellent network of support and learning. While the program has undergone MASSIVE changes since I begin in October 2017; many of the changes have been in an effort to improve the experience and success of students. Never before have I been a part of an organization where their goals are TRULY aligned with their clients. In terms of Lambda; it’s students. It has been a truly unforgettable experience and one that I wouldn’t trade for anything. I absolutely learned more relevant knowledge in my 16 months with lambda than I did in my 60 months of College; and the best part is, it’s virtually risk free. As at the end of the day I will be required to pay back a fraction of what my traditional college experience cost with no interest applied and ONLY if I obtain a relevant job in a relevant field at a competitive rate. It sounds too good to be true; but believe me it’s not.<br /><br />
									</p>

									<h2>This is not the code base you are looking for...</h2>
									<p>
										&nbsp &nbsp In order to keep fresh and obtain a sense of what professional programming is all about; I took the time to review some work that my peers completed during their journey to graduation. I took their github repository, forked and cloaned it, then proceeded to figure out how to get the project to run locally. While it seems easy on the outside; this can be somewhat of a challenge.<br /><br />
									</p>
									<p>
										&nbsp &nbsp One of the interesting things about computer programming is you can perform the majority of all programming on any system or OS currently available on the market. However because of this every development environment is different. That being said it was challenging enough just to get the project to run locally. Once that was completed I was able to start poking around the application and studying how it was connected, linked, and what technologies they were using.<br /><br />
									</p>
									<p>
										&nbsp &nbsp While I originally only planned add some additional functionality to one part of the project that seemed lacking; once I started to see how the program was built I noticed some incomplete functions that weren’t readily apparent on the surface. My first thought was to add locations to the businesses, since I didn’t see location in the saved data; I then realized it was due to how they were obtaining business data, and a location for the business was redundant. I then found that their user profile was lacking in both functionality and accessibility. It was built but not accessible within the application. <br /><br />
									</p>
									<p>
										&nbsp &nbsp This is important because it wasn’t something that identified while initially deciding to add to the code base. It wasn’t until after reviewing the product that the lack of functionality became apparent. Then commence the task of finding how they had everything linked up and mimic that style as to not interfere with any complete functionality. I then went through and removed pieces that bloated the project with unnecessary files, and wired up their user profile page to be accessible within the application, finally I reviewed how they backend was built and added some additional fields for a more personalized user profile. All in all the task took much longer than anticipated; but it was nice to be able to go into another teams code base; determine what technologies they were using and then figure out how to build upon the already established project base successfully. It was an awesome experience; even though it’s very daunting at first, once you get passed feeling overwhelmed, piece by piece you get it figured out and then can make some meaningful contributions!<br /><br />
